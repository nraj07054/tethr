# Homebrew cask for Tethr.
#
# Lives here so the tap repo (nraj07054/homebrew-tethr) can point at it, or so
# this file can be copied there on each release. Homebrew installs without
# setting the quarantine attribute a browser download would, so the app opens
# without the "damaged" warning that unnotarised apps otherwise produce.
